To run this Student Course Registration Program, please go through the following sequence:

1] Run ServerCommsController.java from the serverController package

2] Run the GUIController.java file from the clientController package

3] Follow the instructions on the GUI

4] Before running ServerCommsController again, please comment out the init() method in the second line inside the constructor of   
	DBController() because the mySQL tables would have been created at the first run of the program



Bonus Features Implemented:

1. Deployed project; running the server and client on separate machines

2. Maintained a list of Student users (with pre-set names and id numbers) and developed a login/out feature for both Admin and Student

3. Created a separate GUI for an “Admin” with the functionality of creating new courses
